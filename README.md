# üê∏ rainfrog

a database management tui for postgres

![rainfrog demo](vhs/demo.gif)

> [!WARNING]
> rainfrog is currently in beta.

the goal for rainfrog is to provide a lightweight, terminal-based alternative to
pgadmin/dbeaver.

## features

- efficient navigation via vim-like keybindings and mouse controls
- query editor with keyword highlighting and session history
- quickly copy data, filter tables, and switch between schemas
- shortcuts to view table metadata and properties
- cross-platform (macOS, linux, windows, android via termux)

### why "rainfrog"?

> [frogs find refuge in elephant tracks](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/06/190604131157.htm)

## disclaimer

this software is currently under active development; expect breaking changes,
and use at your own risk. it is not recommended to use this tool with write
access on a production database.

## installation

### cargo

after installing rust (recommended to do so via
[rustup](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)):

```sh
cargo install rainfrog
```

### arch linux

arch linux users can install from the
[official repositories](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/rainfrog)
using [pacman](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/pacman):

```sh
pacman -S rainfrog
```

### termux

if you are using [termux](https://termux.dev/), you'll need to install rust via
their package manager:

```sh
pkg install rust
```

and then make sure to install with termux features (and disable default
features):

```sh
cargo install rainfrog --features termux --no-default-features
```

### install script

there is a simple install script that assists in downloading and unpacking a
binary from the release page to `~/.local/bin/`, which you might want to add to
your `PATH` variable if it isn't already there. you'll need to select which
binary is appropriate for your system (if you're not sure, you can find out by
installing rust and running `rustc -vV` to see the "host" target), and the
script also needs [jq](https://github.com/jqlang/jq) and
[fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) installed to run.

```sh
curl -LSsf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/achristmascarl/rainfrog/main/install.sh | bash
```

### release page binaries

1. manually download and unpack the appropriate binary for your os from the
   latest [release](https://github.com/achristmascarl/rainfrog/releases) (if
   you're not sure which binary to pick, you can find out by installing rust and
   running `rustc -vV` to see the "host" target)
2. move the binary to a folder in your `PATH` environment variable

## usage

all arguments are optional; you will be prompted to provide any missing information.

```sh
rainfrog
```

### with individual options

if any options are not provided, you will be prompted to input them.
if you do not provide an input, that option will
default to what is in your environment variables.

```sh
rainfrog \
  --username <username> \
  --host <hostname> \
  --port <db_port> \
  --database <db_name>
```

### with connection url

the `connection_url` must include all the necessary options for connecting
to the database (ex. `postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/postgres`)

```sh
rainfrog --url $(connection_url)
```

### `docker run`

```sh
docker run --platform linux/amd64 -it --rm --name rainfrog \
  --add-host host.docker.internal:host-gateway \
  -e username="<username>" \
  -e password="<password>" \
  -e hostname="host.docker.internal" \
  -e db_port="<db_port>" \
  -e db_name="<db_name>" achristmascarl/rainfrog:latest
```

features

## known issues and limitations

- in addition to the experience being subpar if the terminal window is too
  small, if the terminal window is too large, rainfrog will crash due to the
  maximum area of ratatui buffers being `u16::MAX` (65,535). more details in
  <https://github.com/achristmascarl/rainfrog/issues/60>
- for query results with many columns, the height of the rendered `Table` widget
  may be limited due to the same limitation mentioned above. Could be fixed by
  <https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui/issues/1250>
- on mac, for VS Code and terminal (and perhaps other editors), a setting for
  "use option as meta key" needs to be turned on for Alt/Opt keybindings to
  work. (In VS Code, it's `"terminal.integrated.macOptionIsMeta": true`; in
  kitty, it's `macos_option_as_alt yes` in the config.)
- in visual mode, when selecting an entire line, the behavior is not the same as
  vim's, as it simply moves starts the selection at the head of the line, so
  moving up or down in lines will break the selection.
- mouse events are only used for changing focus and scrolling; the editor does
  not currently support mouse events, and menu items cannot be selected using
  the mouse
