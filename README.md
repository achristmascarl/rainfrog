# üê∏ rainfrog
a database management tui for postgres

![rainfrog demo](demo.gif)

> [!WARNING]
> rainfrog is currently in alpha. 

the goal for rainfrog is to provide a lightweight, terminal-based alternative to pgadmin/dbeaver. 

### features
- efficient navigation via vim-like keybindings for query editor, data table, and menu
- quickly copy data, filter and preview tables, and switch between schemas
- cross-platform (macOS, linux, windows, android via termux)

### why "rainfrog"?
> [frogs find refuge in elephant tracks](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/06/190604131157.htm) 

## disclaimer
this software is currently under active development; expect breaking changes, and use at your own risk. it is not recommended to use this tool with write access on a production database.

## installation
### cargo
after installing rust (recommended to do so via [rustup](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)):
```sh
cargo install rainfrog --locked
```

### termux
if you are using [termux](https://termux.dev/), you'll need to install rust via their package manager:
```sh
pkg install rust
```
and then make sure to install with termux features (and disable default features):
```sh
cargo install rainfrog --locked --features termux --no-default-features
```

### binaries
1. download the appropriate binary for your os from the latest [release](https://github.com/achristmascarl/rainfrog/releases)
2. move the binary to a folder in your `PATH` environment variable

## usage
> [!NOTE]
> `connection_url` must include your credentials for accessing the database (ex. `postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/postgres`) 
```sh
rainfrog --url $(connection_url)
```

## known issues and limitations
- for query results with many columns, the height of the rendered `Table` widget may be limited, as the maximum area of the underlying buffer is `u16::MAX` (65,535). Could be fixed by https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui/issues/1250
- on mac, for VS Code and terminal (and perhaps other editors), a setting for "use option as meta key" needs to be turned on for Alt/Opt keybindings to work. (In VS Code, it's `"terminal.integrated.macOptionIsMeta": true`; in kitty, it's `macos_option_as_alt yes` in the config.)
- in visual mode, when selecting an entire line, the behavior is not the same as vim's, as it simply moves starts the selection at the head of the line, so moving up or down in lines will break the selection. 
- in visual mode, operations on backwards selections do not behave as expected. will be fixed after https://github.com/rhysd/tui-textarea/issues/80
- mouse events are only used for changing focus and scrolling; the editor does not currently support mouse events, and menu items cannot be selected using the mouse
